I'm Alex Chambers, Chief Technology Officer at [Cliffhanger Solutions](https://cliffhangersolutions.com). I lead software infrastructure and web engineering, and we recently expanded to Madrid.

My journey at Cliffhanger started in 2018 as a Software Engineer, building RESTful APIs with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, and implementing enterprise SSO solutions. I left for a stint at Tanium, where I worked on Risk and Benchmark products in Go, before returning to Cliffhanger as CTO in 2024.

I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Arizona State University, where I also worked as a student web developer and technology consultant.

This blog is where I write about software engineering, AI, and the occasional deep dive into technical problem-solving.
